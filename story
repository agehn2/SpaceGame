It all started in the year 2160 when BLANK wanted to take over Earth. BLANK Commander EVIL was prepared to wage all out war on earth, and use
any force necassary. Earth does not think they have the weapon power to defend there planet. They will need as many weapons as they can get by the
time that BLANK makes for there attack. It would be dangerous for Earth to send out multiple ships to gather the weapons from other planets with all the
BLANK patrol ships. So earth will send there greatest general to gather the weapons. All hope is in General GOODS hands.
